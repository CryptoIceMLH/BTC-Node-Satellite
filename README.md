This is part of a three-component integrated system. Each repository handles a different part of the BitSatRelay network:

| Repository | Purpose | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **[BitSatRelay](https://github.com/CryptoIceMLH/BitSatRelay)** | Terminal-HQ Bridge | Main codebase - Nostr to satellite bridge |
| **[BitSatRelay-Ground-Station](https://github.com/CryptoIceMLH/BitSatRelay-Ground-Station)** | Off-Grid Terminals | Terminal-1 kits for off-grid satellite TX/RX (this repo) |
| **[lnbits-bitsatcredit](https://github.com/CryptoIceMLH/lnbits-bitsatcredit)** | Payment System | LNbits extension for Lightning micropayments |

**All three components work together** to create the complete BitSatRelay network.

## What is Terminal-1?

Terminal-1 is an off-grid satellite communication unit that allows Bitcoin nodes and Nostr relays to communicate independently of centralized Internet Service Providers.

**System Integration:**
- Works with **[BitSatRelay](https://github.com/CryptoIceMLH/BitSatRelay)** Terminal-HQ bridge for Nostr to satellite communications
- Uses **[lnbits-bitsatcredit](https://github.com/CryptoIceMLH/lnbits-bitsatcredit)** payment system for Lightning micropayments
- Provides off-grid satellite TX/RX capability for decentralized communications

## Community

This is a wild time we live in - Bitcoin must be prepared for all possible attack vectors, including loss of centralized communications infrastructure.

My name is [CryptoIce](https://x.com/MolonLabeVC), and I'm a proud Bitcoin tech nerd. Join me on this journey into true decentralization!

With your continued support, I can expedite the R&D process and deliver complete documentation faster.
