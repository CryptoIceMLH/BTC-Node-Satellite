This is part of a three-component integrated system. Each repository handles a different part of the BitSatRelay network:

| Repository | Purpose | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **[BitSatRelay](https://github.com/CryptoIceMLH/BitSatRelay)** | Terminal-HQ Bridge | Main codebase - Nostr to satellite bridge |
| **[BitSatRelay-Ground-Station](https://github.com/CryptoIceMLH/BitSatRelay-Ground-Station)** | Ground Station Hardware | Hardware designs for satellite TX/RX terminals (this repo) |
| **[lnbits-bitsatcredit](https://github.com/CryptoIceMLH/lnbits-bitsatcredit)** | Payment System | LNbits extension for Lightning micropayments |

**All three components work together** to create the complete BitSatRelay network.

## Terminal-HQ Base Station

Terminal-HQ is the main base station that bridges Nostr relay communications to satellite transmission.

**System Integration:**
- Runs **[BitSatRelay](https://github.com/CryptoIceMLH/BitSatRelay)** software for Nostr to satellite bridge
- Uses **[lnbits-bitsatcredit](https://github.com/CryptoIceMLH/lnbits-bitsatcredit)** payment system for Lightning micropayments
- Provides satellite TX/RX capability for global decentralized communications
